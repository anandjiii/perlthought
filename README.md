# Hello World App Deployment with GitHub Actions
This repository demonstrates how to set up a GitHub repository and a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment of a simple "Hello World" app using Python.

## Introduction
Hi there! This repository is your guide to automating the deployment of a "Hello World" app using GitHub Actions. The steps are simple and can save you a lot of time when deploying code.

## Repository Setup
To get started, you'll need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up for free at [GitHub](https://github.com/). Then, follow these steps:
1. Click the '+' sign in the top right and select "New Repository."
2. Name your repository and add a short description.
3. Make sure the repository is set to "Public."
4. Click "Create repository."

## Code Upload

Now that you have a repository, it's time to add your Python "Hello World" app. This is a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files."
2. Choose your Python script or create one.
3. Click "Commit changes."

## GitHub Actions Workflow

GitHub Actions allows you to automate tasks. Here's how to set up a workflow for your "Hello World" app:

1. Create a folder named `.github/workflows` in your repository.
2. In this folder, create a YAML file for your workflow, e.g., `python_deploy.yml`.
3. Copy the workflow configuration into this file.
4. Commit and push the changes to your repository's 'main' branch.

## Monitoring the Workflow

Once you've pushed your changes, you can monitor your workflow. Here's how:

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab.
3. You'll see your workflow running. Click on it to view details and logs.

## Conclusion

In a nutshell, this repository is setting up a GitHub repository and a GitHub Actions workflow for Python "Hello World" app. It makes deploying code easier and more efficient.
